        <h1>It can be the start of a drastic change in my life</h1>
        <p>
            While is true that this page pourpose´s in life is to demonstrate my text editing abilitites in web, that doesn´t mean I can´t share some interesting thoghts I had.
            <br>I´m writing this in 2020, covid-19 pandamic year, and it is fair to say that it changed me.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a former civil engineering student (gradute 2021), I saw myself forced to stay home due to the pandamic. That means I literelly lostan entire academic year...
            <br>As the lockdown started here in Brasil, more specificly in Manaus, I´ve started to notice that civil engineering was absolutly NOT my thing.
            <br>I mean, I´ve used a lot of the free time to learn new abilities (such as how to invest in the stock market, online marketing and etc). And I´ve
            <br>noticed was that I didn´t want to learn anything connected to civil engineering. As soon as I started to learn programming, at a free course website call
            <br><a href="https://cursoemvideo.com">'Curso em Vídeo'</a> I just fell in love (academically) again!
        </p>
        <p>
            I started to search for more complete courses and ended up with CS50 with David Malan. So far, it has been a wonderfull experience. 
            <br>I´ve started the course in november, knowing absolutely nothing about computer science. Today, just one month later, here I am 
            <br>writing my first website and considering change to computer engineering! Life is crazy sometimes!!
